    <h1>LAWRENCE BISHNOI SUPPORTER</h1>
    <p></p>
    <br>It is the protection and sanctity provided by laws against cow slaughter that have resulted in a close nexus between the local police and cow vigilantes, resulting in most of the lynching murders all over country. States with the strictest laws reported higher incidents of lynchings â€“ nine cases in Haryana, eight in Uttar Pradesh, seven in Rajasthan, six in Jharkhand and five in both Delhi and Gujarat, together accounting for almost 54% of the total reported cases. Karnataka is an exception; high incidents (relatively) but not so strict laws.

    This is why CJP demands an immediate repeal of unreasonable stringent, discriminatory, harsh and bad laws related to cow protection. To support our campaign to check violence in the name of cow, please become a member.
    Here is a handy ready reckoner of these laws.<br>
